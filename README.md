# IMPORTANT NOTE
If there's an error accessing the Google Places API, download the following Google Chrome extension:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en

Enable cross-origin resource sharing.  For whatever reason, this fixed an error the app may have when accessing
the API.
